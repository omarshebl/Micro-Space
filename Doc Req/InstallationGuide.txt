To ease the burden on you doctor I used pyinstaller to create a one file executable you will
find it the the folder "game" a file called "main.exe"

if you wish to run the source code you need to have >python 3.7 and install pygame using pip installer first using:
pip install pygame

then you can call the game from the source folder a file called "main.py" using
python main.py
