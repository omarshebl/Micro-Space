    press on esc to return to main menu

game:
    use arrows to move and spacebar to shoot
    you can pause while in active game not question by pressing escape

    you have on your right side your sidebar which has all the info you need
        i am going to explain some of them only
        lives: are the the number of aliens you didn't shoot and got away and that number decreases by one every time
        score: is a multiples of 10 of how many alien you shot

        then you have two colored circles (red, blue)
        red is for the simple questions and have two number below it the red number is for how many questions you failed to answer and green for success
        blue is for the hard questiosn and have two number below it the red number is for how many questions you failed to answer and green for success

        then you have at the bottom your power up, they will be faded when you don't have it, and will be fully opaque when you have them
        then you have the types of aliens down below and how many you killed below each type

    you have 7 powerups, one of them is activated automatically by answering a simple question which is the multiplier powerup
    the rest:
        nuke: kills all aliens and activated by key "n"
        health: increases health to 100 and activated by key ""
        armor: lets one damage not affect you and activated by key ""
        revive: restores back lives to 5 and activated by key ""
        auto: answers your next question automatically for you and activated by key ""
        smrtmissile: its a missle you launch that will randomly target an alien and kill him instantly and activated by key ""
        multiplier: multplies your score input by the value you set in variables.py and it is activated automatically

    you have 3 kinds of aliens and 2 kinds of question
        the 3 kinds of aliens are the same and die from one shot
        the 2 kinds of quesstions are different and they are notated by a dot on the upper left corner of an alien if he has one {blue for hard, red for simple}
            the first is a simple question that gives you the multiplier power up with a 15 second timer can be changed in variables.py
            the second is a harder question that gives you a random power from the 7 excluding the multiplier with a 30 second time that can be also changed
            answers are not case sensitive also you have to writh "h" for hex values
